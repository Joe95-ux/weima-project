                Everything went as planned! Layla is a wonderful member of our family. She came home within a month
                of selecting and paying for her. The cost was a bit pricey, but she is worth the money. Weimaraner Home followed
                through with all that they promised us. We might come back in the future for a second doggie.

                I had a wonderful experience with Weimaraner Home. We love our little Dorie! She is wonderful.
                Thanks for
                the easy experience, with puppy updates and calls to keep me informed..

                What an amazing puppy we now have as part of our family. I just want everyone that may feel nervous
                about getting a puppy here to know that like anywhere, there are imperfections, but the thing that
                matters is the wonderful care and service and puppies that get to be a part of your family!

                Filli is an absolute love. He has a great disposition and appears to be
                perfectly healthy! The process with Weimaraner Home was straight forward and they
                were always
                responsive and helpful when we had questions.

                All went very good from start to pick up and bringing Lion home!! Weimaraner Home was
                very communicative, always available and very helpful throughout process. Puppy was
                everything we had hoped and wished for!

                This is the second puppy we have gotten from Weimaraner Home and we'll use them again
                if we decide to get another pup. It's just too easy and the communication through out
                the process is excellent not to mention the quality of the dogs we have received.
